```I implemented a well know game using Python. Blackjack (formerly Black Jack and Vingt-Un) is a casino banking game.The most widely played casino banking game in the world, it uses decks of 52 cards and descends from a global family of casino banking games known as Twenty-One. This family of card games also includes the British game of Pontoon and the European game, Vingt-et-Un. Blackjack players do not compete against each other. The game is a comparing card game where each player competes against the dealer.```

#### Reason for implementing this game: To exercise OOP in Python.

## How to run it <img height="52" width="52" src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92999481/166147080-e3baac9b-3d24-439d-aa7b-4eec7a59edc2.png">

The program will be downloaded first by clicking on the green "Code" button and selecting "Downlad as ZIP" or you can copy the source code directly from the **main.py** file to an IDE (such as **PyCharm**) or text editor (such as **Visual Studio Code**; in this case, you will need to install extensions that allow Python code to run). Or you can clone it.
